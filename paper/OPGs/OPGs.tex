\begin{abstract}
With development of urban modernization, a large number of Organized POI Groups(OPGs), such as multipurpose buildings, business streets and shopping malls, scatter over the city which have a great impact on people's lives and urban planning etc. Nowadays recommender system is based on Point-of-Interest(POI) which plays an important role in ours lives. However, it is well-known that there exists no work about groups of POIs which serves in recommendation. In this paper, we propose an OPGs-Rec, a novel OPGs-Based recommender system that recommends OPGs extracted from sets of POIs to target users by their locations and needs. We will demonstrate step by step how use OPGs to recommend valuable information to target users.

\section{Introduction}
With the proliferation of spatial data, lots of research work on spatial recommendation has been presented. The development of urban modernization fosters a large number of hot spots, such as multipurpose buildings, business streets and shopping malls. One of these hot spots is larger than a single POI and smaller than a functional region\cite{Yuan12}. Intuitively, a large hot spot is defined as Oganized POIs Group(OPG)\cite{Xu15} has a set of POIs which locate close to each other. The OPGs not only reflect the distribution of the center of city, but also have a great effect on recommendation. If an user plans a series of activities(e.g., shopping, watching a movie or having dinner), the existing approaches usually recommend the best POI according to evaluation functions. Users will receive a set of nearest POIs which cover all of user's requirements\cite{Cao11} or a set of related POIs with higher ranking\cite{Chen15}. However, people have their individual requirements and all of above POIs-Based recommendation systems cannot meet all of people's requirements simultaneously. Besides, an enormous number of people are unclear about their requirements until they have a visit to the POI recommended. For example, a woman plans to buy a pair of shoes. But she is unclear about what kind of shoes she wants until she has a shopping. There are also so many other possibilities after buying a pair of shoes. Maybe she suddenly wants to buy a skirt to match her new shoes. Obviously, the OPGs-Based recommendation offers user more choices than traditional POIs-Based recommendation. Hence, recommending a set of shopping malls which with a higher ranking is better than recommending several shoes shops according to evaluation functions because the users can choose the best one just thinking it over with a little time.

To recommend a set of Organized POIs Groups, this paper proposes a novel system OPGs-Based Recommender System(OPGs-Rec). It will be shown that when an user plans a series of activities, recommendation based OPGs is more efficient and the accuracy does not obviously decrease. The solution to discovering OPGs from lots of POIs is a variant of density-based clustering algorithm, i.e. DBSCAN\cite{Xu15}. After clustering POIs, we get a complete file \textit{R} which contains a set of OPGs $O=<O_1, O_2, O_3...O_n>$. Each OPG contains a set of POIs which locate close to each other, i.e. $O_i=<P_1, P_2, P_3...P_n>$. There is $P_i=<LOG, LAT, M, L, I>$ which indicates geographical longitude, geographical latitude, address of POI, tags of POI and ID of OPGs in order. For these sets of $P_i$, we extract the name information of OPGs from sets of $P_i.M$ which group by value of $P_i.I$ for further recommendation.

\section{System Overview} \label{sec:model}
As shown in Figure 1, our recommender system OPGs-Rec has two layers: Web architecture layer and Data-Processing layer. The front-end of our recommender system is designed with a good interaction and presentation. The backstage of OPGs-Rec provides an interface for interacting with Mysql storing a series of dataset that processed by Data-Processing layer. Each party has several components and their functionalities are described as follows.

\textbf{Web layer:}
The front end of website is designed with a good interaction and presentation. As you can see, in Figure 2, there are three regions forming our page: keyword-select, result table and the map display. When you visit our page, you can delimit the scope with a circle when you click the button is at upper right corner. Then you can select the keywords got from google POI classification\footnote{http://lbs.juhe.cn/data.php?PHPSESSID=acunetixsessionfixation} in keyword-select region. Finally, the backstage returns OPGs related all keywords you input. The feedback results are shown ordered by the linear addition of distance from circle center and the evaluation ranking. Note that, if you do not delimit the scope, this page will raise a warning. 

Generally, the data entry $IN = (L, R, K)$ created in font-end is considered as input data of our recommendation. $IN.L$ and $IN.R$ is the center and radius of circle. $IN.K$ is the keywords that users can select. The output data depends on these three elements is represented as the $OUT=(ID, Info)$ indicates the ID and information of OPGs. Every OPG in $OUT$ is displayed as a covering in the map.The audience could act as users and visit our website in http://ada.suda.edu.cn/opg/. 

\textbf{Data Processing layer:}
In this layer, we process the original POIs dataset using a variant of density-based clustering algorithms i.e. DBSCAN using hybrid similarity which different from traditional DBSCAN.(The details can be seen in \cite{Xu15}.) In this way, we can get a set of OPGs $O = (O_1, O_2, O_3... O_n)$ mentioned above. Then we we extract the name information of OPGs. As you can see, in Figure3, there are 701 OPGs clustered from original POIs dataset.

\textbf{System Implementation:} The Web layer is implemented as a B/S pattern based on Apache2.4, php7 and Baidu Map API\footnote{http://developer.baidu.com/map/reference/index.php}. For Data-Processing layer, we use OpenJDK8 Runtime Environment and OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM to processing POIs dataset and output sql file to insert keywords and some supplementary information to Mysql. The version of Mysql is Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.12-MariaDB, for Linux (x86-64).

\section{Performance}\label{sec:demon}
This section, we conduct experiment using the POIs data in Beijing(2014) which has 490317 POIs. We process this dataset getting 701 OPGs stored in Mysql. Figure 4 shows that the different running time of OPGs-Rec and POIs-based when there are different numbers of keywords.  As you can see, the OPGs-Rec is more efficient than POIs-Based recommendation. In Figure 5, with the increasing of keywords, the accuracy of OPGs-Rec increases obviously. In table 1, it shows the number of POIs and OPGs that recommended depending on different distances from location of users. The OPGs-Rec greatly increases efficiency and accuracy of recommendation obviously. When an user plans a series of activities, he can find all he wants in several OPGs quickly and accurately.
